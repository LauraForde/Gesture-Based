This project is for our Gesture Based User Interface Development module and it will be worth **60%** of our final grade. We are going to make a car game using Unity and the Myo armband.

## Purpose of The Application  
RoadRage unlike most car games is a one player Gestured Based Game. Gesture Based, meaning the user controls the game by physically making gestures at the device instead of controlling it by using a keypad or mouse. The aim of the game, is that the player acts as a car that is 
speeding whilst dodging cars. If the users car collides with a computer generated car then the game ends.


## Gestures Identified as Apropriate For This Application  
For our application we decided that hand gestures would be best suited.

Using the Myo connect the user controls the car by usinng some of the gestures familiar to the myo.
Myo Connect has various hand gestures it recognizes along with the accelerometer and the gyroscope.
However for our application we are using the "wave-in" and "wave-out" gestures to move the car
from left to right in order to avoid the oncoming game generated cars for the game to continue.
