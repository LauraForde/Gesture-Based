This project is for our Gesture Based User Interface Development module and it will be worth **60%** of our final grade. We are going to make a car game using Unity and the Myo armband.

## Purpose of The Application  
RoadRage unlike most car games is a one player Gestured Based Game. Gesture Based, meaning the user controls the game by physically making gestures at the device instead of controlling it by using a keypad or mouse. The aim of the game, is that the player acts as a car that is 
speeding whilst dodging cars. If the users car collides with a computer generated car then the game ends.


## Gestures Identified as Apropriate For This Application  
For our application we decided that hand gestures would be best suited.

Using the Myo connect the user controls the car by using some of the gestures familiar to the myo.
Myo Connect has various hand gestures it recognizes along with the accelerometer and the gyroscope. The following image shows the 
gestures that the Myo responed to: ![gestures](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15687193/38718413-e1dedcfa-3ee4-11e8-971c-5f4acfe5db49.png "Myo Gestures")
However for our application we are using the "wave-in" and "wave-out" gestures to move the car
from left to right in order to avoid the oncoming game generated cars for the game to continue.


## Hardware Used in Creating The Application  
> ### Myo 
> Myo armband is manufactured by Thalmic Labs and is a device in which is worn on the forearm.
> It uses a set of electromyographic (EMG) sensors that sense electrical activity iin the forearm muscles. 
> The myo using the EMG sensors then translates the electrical activity from the muscles into computer commands.
> The EMG sensors combined with a gyroscope, accelometer and magnetometer, recognizes gestures made by the user
> to do certain tasks on the device it is connected to.  

> ### Unity
> Unity, developed by Unity Technologies is a cross platform game engine used to develop two-dimensional and 
> three-dimensional games and simulations for computers, consoles and mobiles.

> Unity uses drag and drop functionality along with C# scripting. Unity also supports JavaScript.
> For 2D games, Unity allows importation oof sprites and an advanced 2D world renderer.
> For 3D games, Unity allows specification of texture compression, mipmas, and resolution settings for platforms along with various functionalities.
